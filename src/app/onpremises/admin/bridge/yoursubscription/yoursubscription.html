          When you are logged in your codenvy.com account, we can determine if you have an active subscription to Codenvy On-Prem
          and unlock all the configuration options.

          If you do not have a subscription to Codenvy On-Prem, no worries!

      Your installation will continue to operate normally. Codenvy will automatically download new version and anonymously send usage data back to us. By
      purchasing a subscription, you can disable automatic downloads and anonymous data, get premium (human)
      support, and generate compliance reports for your legal department. While the Codenvy IDE is open source,
      Codenvy On-Prem is not. We depend upon your patronage to continue building great software for you.

      Please consider a commercial relationship with us. Your mother would approve.
